# EDA F1 Dataset


Formula 1 aka F1 is a competitive sport which includes extreme Engineering and split second decision making. The decision making is done after considering a lot many parameters and also in the real time. Hence, comes the need of using Data Science to explore  the opportunity for performance improvement and try to win it by that left over fraction of second.

This is a preliminary study comparing some of the basic variables involved in this highly competitive sport. I have got the dataset from kaggle and tried to get some insights into it.
